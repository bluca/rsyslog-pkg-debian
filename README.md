rsyslog-pkg-debian
==================

Build system for Debian packages.

**Note** Debian packages are usually quite current in sid. This packaing effort is primarily done in order to provide the most current versions of rsyslog and also do so for slightly "older" Debian versions.

**Do NOT submit problem reports for these packages to the Debian bug tracker** - use the github tracker instead.
